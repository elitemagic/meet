# meet

A serverless, Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with React (using a test-driven development (TDD) technique) using the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. Features have been broken down into 6 parts, each defined below and coupled with user scenarios of operation.

The project dependencies include JavaScript and AWS, with the key technologies including React.


	Feature 1: Filter Events by City
User story:
As a user I should be able to filter events by city So that I can see the list of events that take place in that city

Scenarios

Scenario 1: When user hasn't searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities. Given user hasn’t searched for any city When the user opens the app Then the user should see a list of all upcoming events

Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city. Given the main page is open When user starts typing in the city textbox Then the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list. Given the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox And the list of suggested cities is showing When the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list Then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”) And the list of suggestions should disappear And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city

	Feature 2: Show/Hide an Event's Details
User story

As a user I should be able to show and hide event details So that I can get more information specifically about events of interest.

Scenarios

Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default Given the user has just selected the city for which they wanted to browse events When the user receives the list of events in that city Then all event elements should be collapsed by default

Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details Given the user has identified an event of interest When the user clicks on that event element Then the element should expand And display its details

Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details Given the user has obtained all information they need about the event When the user clicks on that event element Then the element should collapse And hide its details again

	Feature 3: Specify Number of Events
User story

As a user I should be able to specify the number of displayed events So that I have control about how many events I want to see.

Scenarios

Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number Given the user has not specified the number of events they want to see per city When the user receives the list of events in that city Then a number of 32 events should be displayed by default

Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see Given the user received a list of 32 events per selected city When the user wants to see more or less events per city Then they should be able to modify the event number

	Feature 4: Use the App When Offline
User story

As a user I should be able to use the app when offline So that I can access event information even when there is not internet available.

Scenarios

Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection Given the user lost internet connection When the user accesses the app Then chached data should still be available And an error message should appear

	Feature 5: Data visualization
User story

As a user I should be able to view a chart which displays the number of upcoming events in each city So that I can quickly identify and compare the number of events of different cities.

Scenarios

Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city Given the user has not selected a city When the user wants to compare events between cities Then they should be able to access a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
